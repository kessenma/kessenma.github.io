      <h7> During the 2018/19 academic year I collaborated with two other University of Michigan School of Information students to provide UX research on a search portal for biologists called SciCrunch (which was described by the client as an AI tool for identifying mice and antibodies’). <p><span class="greenHighlight">The primary purpose of SciCrunch is to allow Biologists to search for specimens (rats, mice, swine, guinea pigs, plants, proteins, etc) they are experimenting on and to make biology more accessible.</span></p>  A secondary purpose is to connect researchers with company’s selling organisms. My team started out as a group of four, but then one of us dropped because of family matters. The team was myself, Aaon, and Demery. </h7>

    <p>Phase one’s problem discovery was partially accomplished via the spreadsheets above, and now our team was venturing into the daunting world of user recruitment (which was talked about alllllll the time by our professors for being notoriously difficult). Initially our team reached out to professors and SciCrunch users with @umich.edu emails provided by our client. However, the users we reached out to were not responsive, so we had to tap into our personal network of: friends, GSI contacts, church members, and roommates – which turned out to be the cheapest, fastest, and most effective method to find biologists.<p>

          <li><p><span class="greenHighlight">University of Michigan Cellular & Microbiology Bachelors Graduate: </span></p> Our team did not meet in-person with this user but we texted her plenty of questions about biology. She also gave us informative youtube videos on the Human Genome Project
          </li>
          <li><p><span class="greenHighlight">University of Michigan Bioinformatics Senior: </span></p> This user spoke about his job at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center. He has been working in his current role for 6 months now and does a lot of research in the ‘dry-lab’. Biologists work in dry-labs when their works is on computers with hard data, and biologists work in ‘wet-labs’ when they’re in a lab with lab coats, gloves, and the researchers discover new data. This distinction between the two different areas researchers work in is important for our team to understand, because it means that we mainly want to communicate with researchers in the ‘dry-lab’, as they are the ones that will most likely be the ones uploading and searching information to SciCrunch.

            <h8>Survey attempt #1</h8>
            <br>
            <br>
              <p>Our team asked our client if we could put a survey on their site for users to take. We were given permission to publish one that was proofread by our client first. This seemed fine, and then we started a survey and sent it to our client and received abundant feedback. Ultimately, with the feedback and changes needed to be made, we ran out of time to be able to put the survey up and use the results effectively.</p>
              <div class="space"></div>
              <P>This was a learning lesson for our team. We weren’t exactly sure what to put on the survey and we asked questions that our team had about the site itself instead of how users use the site-- which was the purpose of the surveys. The feedback was very helpful and productive for our team to understand the importance of the surveys. If a poorly designed survey was posted on the site, it was our client and her company that had their professional reputation on the line.</P>
              <div class="space"></div>
              <p>We took the lessons learned from this interaction with the CEO humbly -- and attempted a survey a different way that will be discussed later.</p>

          <h8>Implement:</h8>
          <h7>After building different prototypes with alternatives, it is always important to test the build experience and implement functionality. In light of this, our teams next step was to conduct a preference test with users who are studying fields related to biology and classmates/professionals who have UX experience since they would be able to provide more sophisticated feedbacks for further design improvement.</h7>
          <br>
          <h8>Evaluate:</h8>
          <h7>Based on user feedback from the preference tests using our paper prototypes, our team identified improvements and began the process of building a high-fi prototype for usability testing and A/B testing</h7>


          <hr>

          <h7>The screens provided below show where a lot of our innovations took place. During this phase of our research, we started using prototype development software after absorbing feedback from users. We honed in on one particular search bar with six search categories, in addition to some aspect of the results page, which was a challenge on its own. As a team, we were eager to make grand changes that would alter the interaction with the entire site. However, given feedback and more clear direction from our client, we were able to narrow our scope to make helpful changes to the main search functionality and some search feedback. Though some changes are small, they are profound in creating a faster search process.
