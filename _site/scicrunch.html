    <h7> During the 2018/19 academic year I collaborated with two other University of Michigan School of Information students to provide UX research on a search portal for biologists called SciCrunch (which was described by the client as an AI tool for identifying mice and antibodies’). <p><span class="greenHighlight">The primary purpose of SciCrunch is to allow Biologists to search for specimens (rats, mice, swine, guinea pigs, plants, proteins, etc) they are experimenting on and to make biology more accessible.</span></p>  A secondary purpose is to connect researchers with company’s selling organisms. My team started out as a group of four, but then one of us dropped because of family matters. The team was myself, Aaon and Demery. </h7>

<td>Help and documentation is relatively difficult to navigate to on the website. Would add a tab or a button specifically for that in order to have a spot to direct users whenever they encounter questions</td>
<td>there is help and documentationn in the navigation menu, but it is 'nested' deeply and difficult to find. I wasn't even aware that tutorials existed till Bella showed us them.</td>
<td>Hard to find a tutorial on how to add a resource or search (there is one, but burried); help desk button is always available, "search tips" available at search bar, but wayyyyy too much information in an inconcise way</td>

<td>Wouldn't be the best person to represent my thoughts about the language since some terms may be scientific; therefore, these terms in particular may be hard to fathom if you are not a biologist studying that specific field. In terms of accessibility, however, the search process overall is clear and consistent</td>
<td>I gave this one a 2 because to me there are some confusing bio words throughout the site, but im not sure if they are confusing to me bc I'm not a biologist, or if they are confusing to biologistst too. </td>
<td>uncertain...would need to check with biologists perhaps?? but most search results titles do not follow any language pattern or particular language template</td>

  <p>Next we wanted to figure out what Biologists themselves thought of the SciCrunch RRID portal and what they would describe it as. To accomplish this we sought user interviews with biologists on campus in Ann Arbor.<p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents-right60 space">
  <p>The cheapest, fastest, and most effective method to find biologists to talk to (for free….) turned out to be utilizing our graduate student instructors and their network of graduate students they knew. This leads us to masters students! Then some of these masters students directed us to their lab heads who often were Drs and were excited to talk to us about their research– however, they were extremely busy, so scheduling was challenging. In our interviews we were primarily searching for answers to these questions: <p>
  </div>
  <div class="contents-right60 space">
  <li>How do professional biologist portal users understand and navigate the search portal?</li>
  <li> How can we make it easier for users to navigate the portal?</li>
  <li> What is the user flow of finding resources on the RRID portal?</li>
  <li> How can we reduce the number of steps a user goes through while interacting with the RRID portal?</li>
