        <h2>Hello Jessica,</h2>

        <p class="lead">Ever since I was in high school and the only club I joined was the youth in government club, I’ve found joy in learning and listening to government members on problems their community’s face. After graduating high school I moved to Seattle and when I attended North Seattle College for an associates degree, I worked for a year in student government. In this position I learned quite a bit of soft skills on how to interact with; college faculty + staff, and work with coworkers who came from all over the world (Japan, Zimbabwe, Germany, etc) to study in Seattle.</p>

        <p class="lead">Then I attended the School of Information and worked on research projects alongside university faculty and graduate students. Here is where I was taught a lot of the skills you’re looking for in this position. Using github in terminal is second nature to me, HTML/CSS/Javascript is how I convey my most important thoughts/projects lately, and testing SQL databases with API calls is the niche I live in. </p>

        <p class="lead">Javascript is something I honestly wasn’t taught much in UMSI, but I have been on/off self-teaching it myself ever since 2017. I’ve started picking it up a lot more lately in the last ten months again and would absolutely like to work on projects that use it. Right now the library I am getting lost in is threeJS. Which I don’t think this platform would necessarily need since it’s all about 3d-rendering+javascript, but I also am studying up on react.js and it seems extremely powerful too (Netflix is built on react.js!). The site you’re attempting to build sounds more like the website: Angel list.</p>

        <p class="lead">Thanks for reading! </p>
