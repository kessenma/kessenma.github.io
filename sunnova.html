title: Sunnova Catalyst

about: Sunnova's main service offering is financing for solar panel systems for residential homes; and they use mobile apps to help accomplish this-- which is where my software development skillsets come in.  The app I helped build in 2023 (with a team of ~15 people) is called 'Sunnova Catalyst' on the app stores. Catalyst is a business-to-franchise app for Sunnova authorized solar panel dealerships to use with residential solar panel installation. After dealership employees install Sunnova-approved equipment on houses they submit photos of the installed equipment to Sunnova, and then Sunnova sends them a commissioning check after verifying that the equipment is installed correctly through a review website. Throughout this process the consumers also are following along in a "install wizard" through the consumer facing app (after they pass the underwriting process), and once their equipment is installed they can use the app to monitor/customize their residential home energy systems.

about1: The app I spent about a year working on updated the photo submission process for solar panel dealers and the Sunnova infrastructure (photo) reviewers, and it is actually the third time Sunnova has updated this submission process. The first was dealers sending emails with photos to Sunnova, the second was a Xamarin-based (Microsoft's cross-platform mobile development framework) app that allowed single PDF uploading, and this latest app I built is their new update to the process— a React native and typescript app. This newest version of the commissioning app/process has custom survey logic that supports photo-uploading, comments, and approving/rejecting. The codebase also has a website for Sunnova´s electrical engineering reviewers that allows them to leave comments on why a commissioning package was rejected, and the rejection details + history are saved in Salesforce for Sunnova corporate staff to monitor and assist when needed.

about2:  The purpose of this website is to display what I built while at Sunnova because it was an innovative businesses and I enjoyed my time,... However, my time at Sunnova came to an end (consultants left, my boss quit, and I was burnt out).  I have rested a bit, and now I am ready to hop back on the saddle for new software developer opportunities utilizing any of the following languages> JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, or Rust.

customers: Customers
customers1: As of 2023 Sunnova had 348k+ Customers, and there are approximately ~500 systems installed daily through the Sunnova dealership network.

locations: Locations
locations1: Sunnova operates in 47 US States and Territories. They have a large presence in Puerto Rico already (assisted rebuilding eletrical grid infrastructure after hurricane Maria in 2017), and they're attempting to expand into the German market. They also have remote employees all over the globe.

founded: Founding
founded1: John Berger started Sunnova in Houston in 2012 and a lot of the senior staff are from the traditional Houston oil and gas industry, banking peoples, and so many former consultants. I am very grateful for the time I was able to spend learning from these folks.

ipo_info: IPO
ipo_info1: Sunnova IPO'd in 2019 with Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse as the underwriters (14,000,000 shares of its common stock at $12.00 per share = $16.8 million market capitalization).


dealers: Dealerships
dealers1: There are 1.3k dealerships in Sunnova's network that the Catalyst app was built to support.

energy_loan: D.o.E
energy_loan1: In 2023 the Department of Energy approved $3 billion worth of financing as backstop for Sunnova for customers that stop paying for their solar systems. The goal with this financing is to provide lower income areas in the US access to solar power, and the funding is a part of "project Hestia".

salesforce: Salesforce
salesforce1: Salesforce used Sunnova as a case study in their Dreamforce 2023 conference, and I was told that Sunnova had the largest salesforce instance in the southern US. I worked on the development of the Mulesoft data flows mentioned in this video below that enable Sunnova to make quotes in 15 minutes on customers who want solar equipment installed on their home.

app_reeditions: App History
app_reeditions1: The Sunnova consumer facing app was launched in 2023. The Sunnova Catalyst app has been designed twice now-- the first time with Xamarin for mobile apps and Ionic for web apps, and the most recent mobile and web apps were built in one typescript codebase for react native and react for web.


doe_hestia: Project Hestia is a joint project, The Sunnova app and portal aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance the integration of load controllers and smart appliances, and support grid stability by giving consumers near real-time insight into their residential energy system and quantifying the location-specific emissions impact of changes in consumer behavior.

microgrid: Microgrids
microgrid1: are extremely important to Sunnova's current strategy. A solar panel microgrid is a localized energy system that uses solar panels to generate electricity, incorporates batteries for storage, and distributes power within a specific area.


micro_grids_description:  I didn't work on microgrid's much but think they're interesting and wanted to try making an interactive javascript map of connected microgrid's for fun.

micro_grids_description1: Microgrids represent a convergence point for government initiatives, environmental projects, and private sector innovation. The Department of Energy's support for microgrid technologies fosters a regulatory and funding environment conducive to their growth. Projects like Hestia ($3 billion dollar grant for Sunnova if customers in low income areas fail to pay thier solar-equipment payments essentially) , which focus on sustainability and carbon reduction, highlight the need for decentralized and renewable energy solutions that microgrids offer. Meanwhile, solar companies provide the essential technology and expertise to build the renewable energy infrastructure that powers these microgrids, aligning with both governmental and environmental objectives.

Features: The codebase for Catalyst supports an ios and android app for solar-dealerships to submit (solar installation) 'site-survey's' and 'commissioning packages' to Sunnova for review so that the solar-dealerships can get a commissioning-payout from Sunnova. There also is a web app for Sunnova-corporate-staff/engineers to review site-survey's + commissioning packages and approve/reject them. All these apps use Salesforce to store data and communicate with each other. The main purpose of all these embedded apps inside/connecting other apps is to help dealerships (with Sunnova as the Franchise owner) sell + install solar panel systems and accessories.

siteSurvey1: Before Sunnova can quote a customer with how much installing solar equipment on their property will cost they need to figure out some specifications of the property. ie; roof pitch, attic + roof rafter specs, subpanel + main breaker, what electrical utility company they are using, etc, etc. This portion of thier app is called "site survey", and it is a survey that dealers fill out, and then the data is saved in postgres Sql tables. Then the data from these SQL tables is ported over to Salesforce via Mulesoft. Below are some screenshots from this survey. the survey-prompt-types supported are> photo, number, long-text, multiple selection, boolean, and some questions can be marked as "does not apply". Below are some example screens from the site-survey portion of the app.

commissioningPackage1: After a customers property has been inspected, and they want to move forward with the solar installation process solar-dealerships will install the equipment to Sunnova's specifications, and then use the primary feature of the Catalyst mobile app-

commissioningPackage2: submitting commissioning packages to Sunnova.

commissioningPackage3: The gallery below displays the core process of submitting a commissioning package (CP) through the Catalyst app.

architecture: below is the architecture of the Sunnova app.

Lessons: there were a lot of lessons learned from this project. It was my first time getting a 100% software development role and also my first time working a role that was as remote based as this one. I've worked remote for a few professors in university at Umich as a research assistant focusing on statistics, but I met with these professors weekly to analyze data. This role at Sunnova only met once in a year long period... There was also an absurd amount of turn over and management rotations. Which I was not used to at ALL. the companies and schools I've worked at previously were centuries old and bedrock to the economies they supported. However, since Sunnova was so young and growing so fast-- I got to wear so many hats and learned so much. I craved this after my last role has a history of keeping employees trapped in roles and limiting rotations. but it also led to me biting more than I could chew.
