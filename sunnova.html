title: SUNNOVA CATALYST
about: "Sunnova's main service offering is financing + installation for solar panel systems, and they operate a franchise business model where solar-panel-dealerships receive commissioning checks from Sunnova when they successfully install solar panel systems. Sunnova and dealerships use a mobile app I helped build in 2023 called Catalyst (available on <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunnova-catalyst/id1664577662' target='_blank'>iOS</a> and <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunnova.dealermobileapp&hl=en_US&gl=US' target='_blank'>Android</a>) to facilitate the communication between Sunnova and Dealership employees. After dealerships install Sunnova-approved equipment on properties, they submit photos of the installed equipment using the Catalyst app. Sunnova then sends dealerships commissioning checks after their engineers verify that the equipment was installed correctly. Throughout this process, consumers also follow along in an 'install wizard' in the consumer facing app (available on <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunnova/id1604631393' target='_blank'>iOS</a> and <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunnova.dealermobileapp&hl=en_US&gl=US' target='_blank'>Android</a>) (after the underwriting process), and once their equipment is installed, customers can use the customer-facing app to monitor and customize their residential home energy systems."
about2: "The purpose of this website is to display what I built while at Sunnova because it was an innovative business, and I enjoyed my time there. However, my tenure at Sunnova concluded due to shifting dynamics within the organization, including the departure of consultants and management changes. Following a period of rest and reflection, I am now eager to re-engage in the software development realm and am seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, or Rust. Either remote or in the following locations: (preferred) Austria, Germany, Switzerland; and these cities in the United States: (secondary) Chicago, NYC+NJ region, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Seattle, Boston; (tertiary) Miami, Austin, or the Bay Area."



customers: "Customers"

founded: Founding
founded1: "<a href='https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-berger' target='_blank'>John Berger</a> started Sunnova in Houston in 2012 and a lot of the senior staff are from the traditional Houston oil and gas industry, banking professionals, and many former consultants. I am very grateful for the time I was able to spend learning from these professionals."

ipo_info: IPO
ipo_info1: "Sunnova had an <a href='https://investors.sunnova.com/news-events-and-presentations/news-details/2019/Sunnova-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx' target='_blank'>Initial Public Offering in 2019</a> with Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs as the underwriters (14,000,000 shares of its common stock at $12.00 per share = $168 million market capitalization)."

dealers: Dealerships
dealers1: "There are 1,300 dealerships in Sunnova's network, which the Catalyst app was built to support."

app_reeditions: App History
app_reeditions1: "The Sunnova consumer-facing app was launched in 2023. The Sunnova Catalyst app has been designed twice now-- the first time with Xamarin for mobile apps and Ionic for web apps. The most recent mobile and web apps were built in a single TypeScript codebase for React Native and React for web."

salesforce: Salesforce
salesforce1: "Salesforce used Sunnova as a <a href='https://www.salesforce.com/customer-stories/sunnova-connected-data-automation/' target='_blank'>connected data automation</a> case study at their Dreamforce 2023 conference, and I was told that Sunnova had the largest Salesforce instance in the southern US. I worked on the development of the Mulesoft data flows mentioned in this video below that enable Sunnova to generate quotes within 15 minutes for customers who want solar equipment installed on their homes."

energy_loan: D.o.E
energy_loan1: "In 2023 the Department of Energy approved $3 billion worth of financing as a backstop for Sunnova in case customers stop paying for their solar systems. The goal of this financing is to provide lower-income areas in the US with access to solar power, and the funding is a part of <a href='https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-announces-3-billion-partial-loan-guarantee-sunnovas-project-hestia' target='_blank'>Project Hestia</a>."


doe_hestia: Project Hestia is a joint project. The Sunnova app and portal aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance the integration of load controllers and smart appliances, and support grid stability by giving consumers near real-time insights into their residential energy systems and quantifying the location-specific emissions impact of changes in consumer behavior.

microgrid: Microgrids
microgrid1: "Microgrids are extremely important to Sunnova's current strategy. A solar panel <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgrid' target='_blank'>Microgrid</a> is a localized energy system that use solar panels to generate electricity, incorporates batteries for storage, and distributes power within a specific area. Sunnova is... (in my own words) essentially Enron reincarnated, except with solar power instead of gas pipelines. They recently acquired a homebuilding company called <a href='https://investors.sunnova.com/news-events-and-presentations/news-details/2021/Sunnova-Completes-Acquisition-of-SunStreetLennars-Solar-Platform-for-Homebuilders/default.aspx' target='_blank'>SunStreet</a> and approximately 250,000 homes were added to Sunnova's network."


micro_grids_description1: Microgrids represent a convergence point for government initiatives, environmental projects, and private sector innovation. The Department of Energy's support for microgrid technologies fosters a regulatory and funding environment conducive to their growth. Projects like Hestia ($3 billion dollar grant for Sunnova if customers in low-income areas fail to pay their solar-equipment payments), which focus on sustainability and carbon reduction, highlight the need for decentralized and renewable energy solutions that microgrids offer. Meanwhile, solar companies provide the essential technology and expertise to build the renewable energy infrastructure that powers these microgrids, aligning with both governmental and environmental objectives.

Features: ‚ùåNOT USED RN The codebase for Catalyst supports an iOS and Android app for solar dealerships to submit (solar installation) 'site surveys' and 'commissioning packages' to Sunnova for review so that the solar dealerships can receive a commissioning payout from Sunnova. There is also a web app for Sunnova corporate staff/engineers to review site surveys and commissioning packages and approve/reject them. All these apps use Salesforce to store data and communicate with each other. The main purpose of all these embedded apps inside/connecting other apps is to help dealerships (with Sunnova as the Franchise owner) sell and install solar panel systems and accessories.


siteSurvey1: Before Sunnova can install energy equipment, property specifications are required. Some examples are roof pitch, attic and roof rafter specs, subpanel and main breaker info, and which electrical utility company is used. To accomplish this information discovery, Sunnova has a feature in their Catalyst app called "site survey," which allows solar sales consultants to submit customer property data to Sunnova's Salesforce instance for case management. The survey prompt types supported are; photo, number, long-text, short-text, multiple selection, boolean, and some questions can be marked as "does not apply." Below are some example screens from the site survey portion of the app.

commissioningPackage1: "After solar panel energy systems are installed, solar panel dealerships use the Catalyst mobile app to submit proof of the solar equipment installations so that they can:"

commissioningPackage2: receive commissioning checks from Sunnova.

commissioningPackage3: The gallery below displays the core process dealership employees go through when submitting a commissioning package through the Catalyst app to Sunnova corporate for their engineers to review.

commissioningPackageCaptionLogin: "Login screen using Salesforce Experience Cloud for authentication."
commissioningPackageCaptionHome: "This is what dealers see when they have bookmarked projects they are working on. If no projects are bookmarked, They can use the search bar for a project."
commissioningPackageCaptionProjectScreen: "When a project is selected, dealers can see if the site survey or commissioning packages have been submitted, rejected, not started, or are incomplete."
commissioningPackageCaptionInitialSetup: "If a commissioning package has not been started, dealers will be prompted to set up a commissioning package if they select it on the previous screen."
commissioningPackageCaptionSystemDetails: "When setting up a commissioning package, this is where dealerships will enter the equipment being installed."
commissioningPackageCaptionTaskList: "Once the equipment has been entered in the previous screen, the tasks needed to verify it has been installed correctly will be displayed."
commissioningPackageCaptionTaskScreen: "This is an example of what an individual task looks like. All the tasks in the commissioning package are photo uploads. No Text inputs are required."
commissioningPackageCaptionSubmission: "After all the tasks have been completed, the dealership can submit the commissioning package to Sunnova for review."
commissioningPackageCaptionRejection: "If a task is not completed correctly, feedback is provided on how to fix the problem and then the dealership can resubmit the commissioning package to Sunnova"

commissioningPackageWeb1: "There also is a complimentary web app to the mobile app solar-dealerships can use. This web app is dual-faceted and accessed via a different login by Sunnova Engineering reviewers to approve, provide feedback, and reject system-installs submitted by dealerships."
commissioningPackageWeb2: "The features in the web app share a lot of the same core-components as the mobile app with some minor UX differences to suit different ways of working with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touch screen mobile phone."

commissioningPackageWeb1setup: "dealership employees access the commissioning package web app via a URL specific to the customer they're servicing."
commissioningPackageWeb2taskScreen: "Once they set up the equipment being installed, they get a list of tasks to complete."
commissioningPackageWeb3photoUpload: "The photo upload process on web supports uploading via drag and drop."
commissioningPackageWeb4photoViewer: "There is a customized photo viewer for images uploaded."
commissioningPackageWeb5rejectionReasons: "After all the tasks have been completed, the commissioning package can be submitted. Then, once it is submitted, the reviewers at Sunnova use this web app via a different login to approve and reject tasks. If a task is rejected, rejection reason(s) and description(s) are provided."
commissioningPackageWeb6approveOrReject: "Once all the tasks have been reviewed, the entire commissioning package can be submitted or rejected."

architectureCaptionDatabase: "Sunnova relies on a serverless architecture for its Catalyst app-- using Heroku as the 'glue' connecting the databases and apps, Docker to view data in SQL tables, and Salesforce + Mulesoft as data pipelines between the apps and the databases."
architectureCaptionCode: "As a React Native app, Typescript is used to handle the backend algorithmic coding logic and then JavaScript (in a React Native syntax) is used in the frontend portion of the app. Cypress and Jest are used for automated testing."
architectureCaptionRelease: "The centerpiece of the release process for the Catalyst app to the app stores is Expo and GitHub actions. In order to release the app to stores for review, the automated tests (in Cypress and Jest) must pass (since it costs money for each Expo run)."
architectureCaptionAnalytics: "New Relic is used to analyze SQL database updates, Sentry is for monitoring click streams users go through along with which screens errors appear, Papertrail is used to monitor AWS errors, and flipper plus postman is used by developers for debugging API calls and errors."

architecture1: "<b>Architecture</b>"
architecture2: "At a high level, the Catalyst app comprises two main features called <i>site survey</i> and <i>commissioning package</i>. Both of these features are essentially surveys that dealership employees use to submit information to Sunnova about a property. The codebase is divided into two main directories: <i>backend</i> and <i>frontend</i>, and the app architecture follows the <a href='https://medium.com/@hiteshsatwani/mvvm-a-guide-for-react-native-and-expo-projects-18d050bdbfb8' target='_blank'>MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)</a> pattern. Here's how the structure is organized:"


frontend1: "<u>Frontend Directory:</u>"

frontend2: "<ul><li><u>View</u>: The view layer files are written in JavaScript. They're responsible for displaying the user interfaces.</li></ul>"

frontend3: "<ul><li><u>View-model</u>: The view-model files are written in TypeScript. They use the <a href='https://sequelize.org' target='_blank'>Sequelize</a> library as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to connect the user interfaces to the SQL database. The functions written in the view-model files are called on in the view layer of the app.</li></ul>"

frontend4: "<ul><li><u>Package Managers</u>: There are ~100 <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/' target='_blank'>NPM</a> libraries imported and used in the frontend of the Catalyst app. Some example packages are: <a href='https://github.com/expo/google-fonts' target='_blank'>Expo Google Fonts</a> for access to Google fonts, <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-image-picker' target='_blank'>Expo Image Picker</a> to access the image gallery from a user's device, <a href='https://react-redux.js.org/' target='_blank'>React Redux</a> to manage state in the app,<a href='https://alexcorvi.github.io/heic2any/' target='_blank'>HEIC 2 Any</a> to convert images on iOS/macOS to JPEG before submitting them, <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-haptics' target='_blank'>Expo Haptics</a> to provide vibration feedback when commissioning packages were submitted correctly,<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-clipboard' target='_blank'>Expo Clipboard</a> to access the users' clipboard.
</li></ul>"






backend1: "<u>Backend Directory:</u>"

backend2: "<ul><li><u>Model</u>: The model files are responsible for defining the data structure and business logic. It is written in TypeScript (with <a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html' target='_blank'>interfaces</a> as the data structure) and uses <a href='https://sequelize.org/' target='_blank'>Sequelize</a> to manage interactions with the SQL database. The model defines tables, fields, and relationships, and includes methods for data operations such as retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data.</li></ul>"



backend3: "<ul><li><u>Migrations</u> manage the evolution of the database schema. They are SQL files that define changes such as adding, modifying, or deleting tables and columns. These migration files run using the <a href='https://flywaydb.org/' target='_blank'>Flyway</a> database-migration-tool.</li></ul>"

cloud1: "<u>Cloud Infrastructure:</u>"

cloud2: "<ul><li><u>Authentication</u> Salesforce is at the root of Sunnova's authentication-process. Using the <a href='https://www.salesforce.com/products/experience-cloud/overview/' target='_blank'>Salesforce Experience Cloud</a> feature in three capacities to authenticate both Sunnova's corporate employees and dealership employees; <i>(1)</i> as a login screen for the Catalyst <i>mobile app</i> used by dealership franchise employees, as a login screen for two <a href='https://nodejs.org/en' target='_blank'>Node.js</a> web-apps hosted on AWS servers called <i>(2)</i>dealer portal (same functionality as the mobile app), and <i>(3)</i> the Engineering Review portal.</li></ul>"

cloud3: "<ul><li><u>Heroku</u>: is a user-friendly way to interact with content in AWS databases/servers, and the Catalyst platform used Heroku to connect to six servers running node.js applications six databases in AWS. The servers use <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/' target='_blank'>AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a>, and they are called: dev, QA, and prod for both the mobile app and then the same naming convention for the desktop applications. Three of the <u>databases</u> (called dev, QA, and prod) hosted data using <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/rds/' target='_blank'>AWS Relataional Database Service (RDS)</a> for the SQL databases storing login information, survey prompt responses, and links to the photos uploaded. The last three <u>databases</u> (called dev, QA, and prod) were using <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/s3/' target='_blank'>AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> for photo storage of images the dealership employees were uploading in the app of the properties they were working on.</li></ul>"

cloud4: "<ul><li><u>test</u>:</li></ul>"

cloud5: "<ul><li><u>Continous Intergration (CI) / Deployment (CD)</u>: <a href='https://github.com/features/actions' target='_blank'> GitHub Actions</a> pipelines are used to run through the automated test suite before submitting app updates to Expo.</li></ul>"

cloud6: "<ul><li><u>Build Process:</u> <a href='https://expo.com' target='_blank'> Expo </a> is used to automate the submission process to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store after all the tests have passed in the CI/CD pipeline. </li></ul>"


Data1: "<ul><u>Data</u></ul>"

dataStorage: "<ul><li><u>Data-Storage:</u> <a href='https://www.postgresql.org' target='_blank'>PostrgreSQL</a> databases hosted on <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/rds/' target='_blank'>AWS Relataional Database Service (RDS)</a> servers. </li></ul>"

dataTransferring: "<ul><li><u>Data-Transferring</u> <a href='https://mulesoft.com' target='_blank'>Mulesoft</a> (a Salesforce owned product) is used to connect the data populated in the SQL databases from the Catalyst apps to the Salesforce environments. </li></ul>"

Lessons: there were a lot of lessons learned from this project. It was my first time getting a 100% software development role and also my first time working a role that was as remote-based as this one. I've worked remote for a few professors in university at Umich as a research assistant focusing on statistics, but I met with these professors weekly to analyze data. This role at Sunnova only met once in a year-long period... There was also an absurd amount of turnover and management rotations, which I was not used to at ALL. The companies and schools I've worked at previously were centuries old and bedrock to the economies they supported. However, since Sunnova was so young and growing so fast, I got to wear so many hats and learned so much. I craved this after my last role, which had a history of keeping employees trapped in roles and limiting rotations. But it also led to me biting off more than I could chew.
