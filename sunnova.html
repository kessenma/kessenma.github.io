title: Sunnova Catalyst

about: Sunnova is a(n) energy + financing + software as a service provider for residential consumers, utility companies, and businesses. Their business is complex and I only worked in a small fraction of it via developing their mobile, web, and salesforce applications. The purpose of this website is to display what I built while at Sunnova because it was one of the most interesting projects I've had the opportunity of working on, and I am quite proud of what myself and the rest of the team accomplished. The app is called Sunnova Catalyst on the app stores. My time came to an end at Sunnova a few months ago. and I am now looking for new opporunities in the following cities- Vienna, Berlin, Karlsruhe. Cologne, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, and Hamburg.
about1: Sunnova's main service offering is financing for solar panel systems for residential homes. They also recently published a consumer facing app that used to monitor residential home energy systems. They have contacts in a solar dealer network who install residential solar panels, batteries, load controllers, and car chargers. After dealers install this equipment they submit photos of the installed equipment to Sunnova, and then Sunnova sends them a commissioning check.
about2: The app I spent about a year working on updated the photo submission process for solar panel dealers and the Sunnova infrastructure (photo) reviewers, and it is actually the third time Sunnova has updated this submission process. The first was dealers sending emails with photos to Sunnova, the second was a Xamarin-based (Microsoft's cross-platform mobile development framework) app that allowed single PDF uploading, and this latest app I built is their new update to the process— a React native and typescript app for ios. This newest version of the commissioning app/process has custom survey logic that supports photo-uploading, comments, and approving/rejecting. The code base also has a website for Sunnova´s electrical engineering reviewers that allows them to leave comments on why a commissioning package was rejected, and the rejection details + history are saved in Salesforce for Sunnova coorperate staff to monitor and assist when needed.
