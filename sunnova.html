title: SUNNOVA CATALYST
about: "Sunnova's main service offering is financing + installation for solar panel systems, and they operate a franchise business model where solar-panel-dealerships receive commissioning checks from Sunnova when they successfully install solar panel systems. Sunnova and dealerships use a mobile app I helped build in 2023 called Catalyst (available on <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunnova-catalyst/id1664577662' target='_blank'>iOS</a> and <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunnova.dealermobileapp&hl=en_US&gl=US' target='_blank'>Android</a>) to facilitate the communication between Sunnova and Dealership employees. After dealerships install Sunnova-approved equipment on properties, they submit photos of the installed equipment using the Catalyst app. Sunnova then sends dealerships commissioning checks after their engineers verify that the equipment was installed correctly. Throughout this process, consumers also follow along in an 'install wizard' in the consumer facing app (available on <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunnova/id1604631393' target='_blank'>iOS</a> and <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunnova.dealermobileapp&hl=en_US&gl=US' target='_blank'>Android</a>) (after the underwriting process), and once their equipment is installed, customers can use the customer-facing app to monitor and customize their residential home energy systems."
about2: "The purpose of this website is to display what I built while at Sunnova because it was an innovative business, and I enjoyed my time there. However, my tenure at Sunnova concluded due to shifting dynamics within the organization, including the departure of consultants and management changes. Following a period of rest and reflection, I am now eager to re-engage in the software development realm and am seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, or Rust. Either remote or in the following locations: (preferred) Austria, Germany, Switzerland; and these cities in the United States: (secondary) Chicago, NYC+NJ region, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Seattle, Boston; (tertiary) Miami, Austin, or the Bay Area."



customers: "Customers"
customers1: As of 2023, Sunnova had 348k+ customers, and approximately 500 systems were installed daily through the Sunnova dealership network (before interest rates increased; now, I'm not sure of the current rate)."

locations: Locations
locations1: "Sunnova <a href='https://www.sunnova.com/locations/' target='_blank'> operates in 46 US States and is expanding </a> outside the US as well. They have a large presence in Puerto Rico already (<a href='https://solarmagazine.com/rebuilding-puerto-rico-power-infrastructure-hurricane-maria-first-annual-commemoration/' target='_blank'>assisted rebuilding electrical grid infrastructure after Hurricane Maria</a> in 2017), and they are attempting to expand into the German market. They also have remote employees all over the globe."

founded: Founding
founded1: "<a href='https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-berger' target='_blank'>John Berger</a> started Sunnova in Houston in 2012 and a lot of the senior staff are from the traditional Houston oil and gas industry, banking professionals, and many former consultants. I am very grateful for the time I was able to spend learning from these professionals."

ipo_info: IPO
ipo_info1: "Sunnova had an <a href='https://investors.sunnova.com/news-events-and-presentations/news-details/2019/Sunnova-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx' target='_blank'>Initial Public Offering in 2019</a> with Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs as the underwriters (14,000,000 shares of its common stock at $12.00 per share = $168 million market capitalization)."

dealers: Dealerships
dealers1: "There are 1,300 dealerships in Sunnova's network, which the Catalyst app was built to support."

app_reeditions: App History
app_reeditions1: "The Sunnova consumer-facing app was launched in 2023. The Sunnova Catalyst app has been designed twice now-- the first time with Xamarin for mobile apps and Ionic for web apps. The most recent mobile and web apps were built in a single TypeScript codebase for React Native and React for web."

salesforce: Salesforce
salesforce1: "Salesforce used Sunnova as a <a href='https://www.salesforce.com/customer-stories/sunnova-connected-data-automation/' target='_blank'>connected data automation</a> case study at their Dreamforce 2023 conference, and I was told that Sunnova had the largest Salesforce instance in the southern US. I worked on the development of the Mulesoft data flows mentioned in this video below that enable Sunnova to generate quotes within 15 minutes for customers who want solar equipment installed on their homes."

energy_loan: D.o.E
energy_loan1: In 2023 the Department of Energy approved $3 billion worth of financing as a backstop for Sunnova in case customers stop paying for their solar systems. The goal of this financing is to provide lower-income areas in the US with access to solar power, and the funding is a part of "<a href='https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-announces-3-billion-partial-loan-guarantee-sunnovas-project-hestia' target='_blank'>Project Hestia</a>."


doe_hestia: Project Hestia is a joint project. The Sunnova app and portal aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance the integration of load controllers and smart appliances, and support grid stability by giving consumers near real-time insights into their residential energy systems and quantifying the location-specific emissions impact of changes in consumer behavior.

microgrid: Microgrids
microgrid1: "Microgrids are extremely important to Sunnova's current strategy. A solar panel <a href='https://www.sunnova.com/microgrids' target='_blank'>Microgrid</a> is a localized energy system that uses solar panels to generate electricity, incorporates batteries for storage, and distributes power within a specific area. Sunnova is... (in my own words) essentially Enron reincarnated, except with solar power instead of gas pipelines. They recently acquired a homebuilding company called <a href='https://investors.sunnova.com/news-events-and-presentations/news-details/2021/Sunnova-Completes-Acquisition-of-SunStreetLennars-Solar-Platform-for-Homebuilders/default.aspx' target='_blank'>SunStreet</a> and approximately 250,000 homes were added to Sunnova's network."


micro_grids_description1: Microgrids represent a convergence point for government initiatives, environmental projects, and private sector innovation. The Department of Energy's support for microgrid technologies fosters a regulatory and funding environment conducive to their growth. Projects like Hestia ($3 billion dollar grant for Sunnova if customers in low-income areas fail to pay their solar-equipment payments), which focus on sustainability and carbon reduction, highlight the need for decentralized and renewable energy solutions that microgrids offer. Meanwhile, solar companies provide the essential technology and expertise to build the renewable energy infrastructure that powers these microgrids, aligning with both governmental and environmental objectives.

Features: ‚ùåNOT USED RN The codebase for Catalyst supports an iOS and Android app for solar dealerships to submit (solar installation) 'site surveys' and 'commissioning packages' to Sunnova for review so that the solar dealerships can receive a commissioning payout from Sunnova. There is also a web app for Sunnova corporate staff/engineers to review site surveys and commissioning packages and approve/reject them. All these apps use Salesforce to store data and communicate with each other. The main purpose of all these embedded apps inside/connecting other apps is to help dealerships (with Sunnova as the Franchise owner) sell and install solar panel systems and accessories.


siteSurvey1: Before Sunnova can install energy equipment, property specifications are required. Some examples are roof pitch, attic and roof rafter specs, subpanel and main breaker info, and which electrical utility company is used. To accomplish this information discovery, Sunnova has a feature in their Catalyst app called "site survey," which allows solar sales consultants to submit customer property data to Sunnova's Salesforce instance for case management. The survey prompt types supported are; photo, number, long-text, short-text, multiple selection, boolean, and some questions can be marked as "does not apply." Below are some example screens from the site survey portion of the app.

commissioningPackage1: "After solar panel energy systems are installed, solar panel dealerships use the Catalyst mobile app to submit proof of the solar equipment installations so that they can:"

commissioningPackage2: receive commissioning checks from Sunnova.

commissioningPackage3: The gallery below displays the core process dealership employees go through when submitting a commissioning package (CP) through the Catalyst app to Sunnova corporate.

architecture1: "At a high level, the Catalyst app comprises two main features called <i>site survey</i> and <i>commissioning package</i>. Both of these features are essentially surveys that dealership employees use to submit information to Sunnova about the property. The codebase is divided into two main directories: <i>backend</i> and <i>frontend</i>, and the app architecture follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. Here's how the structure is organized:"

architecture5: "<u>Frontend Directory:</u>"

architecture6: "<ul><li><u>View</u>: The view layer is written in JavaScript. It is responsible for displaying the user interfaces to the users.</li></ul>"

architecture7: "<ul><li><u>ViewModel</u>: The view-model is written in TypeScript. It uses the Sequelize library as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to connect the user interfaces to the SQL database.</li></ul>"


architecture8: "<b><u>Backend Directory:</u></b>"
architecture9: "<ul><li><u>Model</u>: The model is responsible for setting up and managing the SQL database schemas. It is written in TypeScript and located in the backend directory.</li></ul>"

architecture10: "<b><u>Cloud Infrastructure:</u></b>"
architecture11: "<ul><li><u>Salesforce</u>: </li></ul>"
architecture12: "<ul><li><u>Heroku</u>: </li></ul>"



Lessons: there were a lot of lessons learned from this project. It was my first time getting a 100% software development role and also my first time working a role that was as remote-based as this one. I've worked remote for a few professors in university at Umich as a research assistant focusing on statistics, but I met with these professors weekly to analyze data. This role at Sunnova only met once in a year-long period... There was also an absurd amount of turnover and management rotations, which I was not used to at ALL. The companies and schools I've worked at previously were centuries old and bedrock to the economies they supported. However, since Sunnova was so young and growing so fast, I got to wear so many hats and learned so much. I craved this after my last role, which had a history of keeping employees trapped in roles and limiting rotations. But it also led to me biting off more than I could chew.
