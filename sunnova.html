title: Sunnova Catalyst

about: In my own-non PR trained words-- Sunnova is a energy + financing + software as a service provider for residential consumers, utility companies, and businesses. They're based in Houston (I worked remotely for them in Michigan), the business is complex and I only worked in a small fraction of it via developing their mobile, web, and salesforce applications. The purpose of this website is to display what I built while at Sunnova because it was one of the more novel businesses I've had the opportunity of working with,... and I want to show grad-schools + research-institutes + consultancy's what I am capable of. The app is called Sunnova Catalyst on the app stores. My time came to an end at Sunnova a few months ago. and I am now looking for new opportunities in the DACH region of Europe or contract roles in the US. I am primarily interested in software development projects building go-to-market/business/government apps utilizing JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, or Rust.

about1: Sunnova's main service offering is financing for solar panel systems for residential homes. They also recently published a consumer facing app that is used to monitor residential home energy systems. They have contacts in a solar dealer network who install residential solar panels, batteries, load controllers, and car chargers. After dealers install this equipment they submit photos of the installed equipment to Sunnova, and then Sunnova sends them a commissioning check.

about2: The app I spent about a year working on updated the photo submission process for solar panel dealers and the Sunnova infrastructure (photo) reviewers, and it is actually the third time Sunnova has updated this submission process. The first was dealers sending emails with photos to Sunnova, the second was a Xamarin-based (Microsoft's cross-platform mobile development framework) app that allowed single PDF uploading, and this latest app I built is their new update to the process— a React native and typescript app. This newest version of the commissioning app/process has custom survey logic that supports photo-uploading, comments, and approving/rejecting. The code base also has a website for Sunnova´s electrical engineering reviewers that allows them to leave comments on why a commissioning package was rejected, and the rejection details + history are saved in Salesforce for Sunnova corporate staff to monitor and assist when needed.

doe_hestia: Project Hestia is a joint project, The Sunnova app and portal aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance the integration of load controllers and smart appliances, and support grid stability by giving consumers near real-time insight into their residential energy system and quantifying the location-specific emissions impact of changes in consumer behavior.

Features: the code base for Catalyst supports an ios and android app as well as a web app.All these apps use Salesforce to store data and communicate with each other. The main purpose of all these apps working together is to help dealerships sell + install solar panel systems and accessories.

architecture: The Catalyst Mobile app is a mobile app on the Apple App Store + Google Play Store built on React Native.  the image carousel below showcases the technologies Sunnova used to build the 3rd version of the Catalyst app for their dealers. The first and second versions of the app were built with Microsoft Xamrin and had different capabilities. The newest

Lessons: there were a lot of lessons learned from this project. It was my first time getting a 100% software development role and also my first time working a role that was as remote based as this one. I've worked remote for a few professors in university at Umich as a research assitant focusing on statistics, but I met with these professors weekly to analyze data. This role at Sunnova only met once in a year long period... There was also an absurd amount of turn over and managment rotations. Which I was not used to at ALL. the companies and schools I've worked at previously were centuries old and bedrock to the economies they supported. However, since Sunnova was so young and growing so fast-- i got to wear so many hats and learned so much. I craved this after my last role has a history of keeping employees trapped in roles and limiting rotations. but it also led to me biting more than I could chew.
